## Module 1 Capstone - Vending Machine Software

Virtual vending machine application with command-line interface allowing users to deposit money, choose a product, 
and return the correct change. Inventory is loaded via a text file and transactions are also logged to a text file.

This was my team's solution to the module 1 capstone project for the Merit America Java program. I was responsible for
acting as the team lead during this project through delegation of tasks, reviewing code written by other team members, 
designing the project structure, and writing the main functionality of the application. Our goal was to implement the 
knowledge we had gained during the first phase of Merit America's Java program by practicing Object-Oriented Programming
principles and using comments and documentation to create readable and understandable code.
